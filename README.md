## Project Description
This repository is a simulation of [Aman Kharwal's original code](https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2022/11/14/a-b-testing-using-python/) and is only proof of the understanding of A/B Testing.
Detailed should be developed by the analyst based on his/her visualizations! ;)

## Needs of this project

- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- writeup/reporting

## Getting Started

1. First, clone this repository using the following command:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/de-lia/A-B-Testing.git
```
2. Run it on it on your favorite editor. This project was originally created in Pycharm.
2. The various sections of comments represent chunks of code for the visualization of data.
3. Therefore, it'll be preferable to run the project in a virtual environment using Jupyter.
4. You can set up your venv using [this](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/using-jupyter-notebook-in-virtual-environment/).
5. Navigate to the directory of this project, and run:
```sh
